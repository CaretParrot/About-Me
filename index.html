            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Rishi. I am an aspiring web and software developer, music composer, violist, and
                chess enthusiast. I am also the founder of The Composers Foundry, a community dedicated to growing
                the music making community and providing assistance to those who wish to get into the hobby.<br><br>
                Developing programs has always piqued my interest ever since I was little, and I hope to continue to
                create computer programs for the forseeable future. It can often be an arduous process that can even
                take several months, but it has always felt great to use a program that functions smoothly and is
                designed with the user in mind first. Furthermore, the possibilities are endless, so it's a hobby I
                can maintain even as my other interests change over time. In fact, the website you see in front of
                you was coded from the ground up by me! Throughout 2024, I have achieved industry certifications for
                Computer Programming I, Computer Science Principles, and Web Development I.<br><br>
                Soon after the days where I dreamed about the possibilities of computer programming as a young kid,
                I also took up the viola. Through music I found a welcoming and energetic community and have
                received vast amounts of support for my musical education. Because of this, I have been the
                principal violist at my high school orchestra, scored top marks for solo and ensemble performances
                in my district and state, and have played in district and state orchestral ensembles for many
                years.<br><br>
                I also taught myself how to write music when I was younger as well. Originally I did it as an
                experiment to see if I was interested in the hobby, but eventually it became a way for me to escape
                the challenging times of the pandemic and the business of high school life. Despite having taken
                next to no classes in composition or theory, my music writing skills grew thanks to the help of my
                orchestra teacher, and I won the 2023 and 2024 KMEA Jeff Jordan Composition Competitions.<br><br>
                Unlike the previous hobbies, chess is a very recent one. I learned how to play chess when I was much
                younger, but I never took chess training seriously until the middle of 2023. In one year, I gained
                over 800 rapid rating points on chess.com and have reached a peak rating of 1703. I hope to continue
                improving at chess in the future!</p>
